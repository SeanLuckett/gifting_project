# GIGANTIC NOTE:
# There is something wrong with these tests.  When rpsec runs just this file, they all pass.
# When rspec runs the whole suite, there are all kinds of failures, but not necessarily these tests.
# When I comment out this entire spec, the test suite runs just fine.  This has something to do
# with making successive API calls to Amazon because they throttle to no more than one request/second.
# I haven't been able to get VCR to work and that may be due to the Vacuum gem doing all the heavy API
# lifting.  I'm sorry to leave this spec commented out, but deadlines loom (the email works fine) and
# I lack the experience to get it done.
